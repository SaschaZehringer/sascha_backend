# Progress

The Sascha backend project currently has a stable core API with implemented authentication and user management modules.

What works:
- User registration and login with JWT authentication.
- Modular service architecture with clear separation of concerns.
- Basic error handling and logging middleware.
- Unit and integration tests covering critical paths.

What's left to build:
- Additional resource management endpoints.
- Enhanced authorization with role-based access control.
- Improved test coverage and performance optimizations.
- API documentation and developer guides.

Current status:
- Actively maintained with ongoing feature development.
- Preparing for integration with frontend components.

Known issues:
- Some edge cases in error handling need refinement.
- Performance tuning required for high-load scenarios.
