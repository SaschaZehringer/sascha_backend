# Tech Context

The Sascha backend is developed using TypeScript and the NestJS framework, which provides a structured and scalable architecture for building server-side applications.

The development environment includes Node.js, npm for package management, and ESLint and Prettier for code quality and formatting.

The project uses JWT for authentication and authorization, with Passport.js integration.

Testing is done using Jest for unit and integration tests.

The build process is managed via Nest CLI, and the project configuration is maintained in tsconfig.json and nest-cli.json files.

The codebase follows strict typing and modular design principles to ensure maintainability and scalability.
