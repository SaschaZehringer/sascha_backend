# Product Context

The Sascha backend project exists to provide a reliable and secure API service that supports the Sascha system's business logic and data management needs. It solves the problem of centralized data handling and user management for the Sascha ecosystem.

The system should work by exposing RESTful endpoints that allow clients to perform CRUD operations on core resources, authenticate users, and manage UserSessions securely. It should handle errors gracefully and provide meaningful responses.

User experience goals focus on API reliability, clear documentation, and consistent behavior to facilitate integration with frontend and other backend services.
